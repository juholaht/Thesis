This thesis is about heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. The idea is to explore, how the structural causal relations in data are affecting to coveriate selection. The empirical part of the thesis consists with a simulation study, in which the simulations are based on the structural causal models. The estimation method used in the simulation study  is _causal forest_.
